# Beautify with fresh

**Learning objectives:**

- Understand what {fresh} is and why it exists
- Compare {fresh} with {Sass}, understand who each is for and when/why one might be appropriate
- Learn how to use `create_theme()`
- re-style {bs4dash} elements using {fresh}
- Combine {fresh} with {Thematic} for static plots
- Experience customising {shinydashboard}


## fresh as a high-level tool

{fresh} is a high-level tool for styling Shiny applications. Made by creators of shinyWidgets, Esquisse ![dreamRs Github](https://github.com/dreamRs)

It aims to simplify the process of applying custom themes to entire Shiny apps, or editing bootstrap themes; allowing us to control CSS styling elements.

Similar to {shinythemes} but importantly different: 

{shinythemes}:
- bank of pre-built bootstrap themes with limited customisability (but great for a super quick app facelift)

{fresh}:
- From scratch theme creation + ability to customise existing themes

## fresh or sass?

In some ways, what {fresh} is to {shinythemes}, {sass} is to {fresh}. 

{sass} 
- Provides us with low-level ways to re-style css and avoid repetition of code, through variables, mixins, nested rules, etc.
- Requires grounding in CSS and not always so easy to identify which variables we need to change
- syntax slightly different to CSS, extra things for R developers to learn - the feel of sass functions is different to R functions

{fresh}
- Built on top of {sass}
- However, with R functions for creating our themes & styles which feel more like R functions (or which abstract away a lot of things)

## Interactive Exploration of Fresh

![Let's cook](image/07_01_lets_cook.png)

```{r}

```


## Using create_theme()

As promised, {fresh} provides us with a simple-to-use function for creating our themes: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(fresh)
create_theme(
  ...,
  theme = c("default", "cerulean", ...),
  output_file = NULL,
  include_assets = FALSE
)
```

 To `...` we pass in lists of CSS variables declared with bs_vars_* or adminlte_* functions.
To theme we pass in the base theme to use (think back to our recent cooking acitivity)
output_file determines whether a file is created for compiled CSS or not, otherwise returns a string
include_assets - logical, only use if output_file is not NULL. Copies Bootstrap & Bootswatch fonts. if TRUE, output path modified to 'stylesheets', an intermediate directory where CSS file will be located.

## create_theme example (from package docs)
```{r, eval = FALSE}
#using a temporary file but use the path you want
tmp <- file.path(tempdir(), "custom-theme.css")

# Create the new theme
create_theme(
  theme = "default",
  bs_vars_color(
    brand_primary = "#75b8d1",
    brand_success = "#c9d175",
    brand_info = "#758bd1",
    brand_warning = "#d1ab75",
    brand_danger = "#d175b8"
  ),
  bs_vars_navbar(
    default_bg = "#75b8d1",
    default_color = "#FFFFFF",
    default_link_color = "#FFFFFF",
    default_link_active_color = "#FFFFFF"
  ),
  output_file = tmp
)

# Use the file created at the path provided
# in your Shiny app by moving it in the
# www/ folder, then use it in UI

library(shiny)
fluidPage(
  theme = "custom-theme.css"
)

# clean up
unlink(tmp)
```


## Customising bs4Dash

Building on from the {sass} example, {fresh} makes customising bs4Dash even simpler.

Two key helpful functions. `bs4dash_status()` allows us to change the colours of status elements.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
bs4dash_status(
  primary = NULL,
  secondary = NULL,
  success = NULL,
  info = NULL,
  warning = NULL,
  danger = NULL,
  light = NULL,
  dark = NULL
)

?bs4dash_status()
```

Default values:
primary	 Default: #0073b7.
secondary	Default: #6c757d.
success	 Default: #28a745.
info	 Default: #17a2b8.
warning	 Default: #ffc107.
danger	 Default: #dc3545.
light	 Default: #f8f9fa.
dark	 Default: #343a40.


## bs4dash_color

```{r, eval = FALSE}
bs4dash_color(
  blue = NULL,
  lightblue = NULL,
  navy = NULL,
  cyan = NULL,
  teal = NULL,
  olive = NULL,
  green = NULL,
  # ...
)
?bs4dash_color()
```
Defaults: 
blue	 Default: #007bff. This color is used for primary status.
lightblue	 Default: #3c8dbc.
navy	 Default: #001f3f.
cyan	Default: #17a2b8. This color is used for info status.
teal	Default: #39cccc.
olive	Default: #3d9970.
green	Default: #28a745. This color is used for success status.
lime	Default: #01ff70.
orange	Default: #ff851b.
yellow	Default: #ffc107. This color is used for warning status.
fuchsia	Default: #f012be.
purple	Default: #605ca8.
maroon	Default: #d81b60.
red	Default: #dc3545. This color is used for danger status.
black	Default: #111.
gray_x_light	Default: #d2d6de.
gray_600	Default: #6c757d. This color is used for secondary status.
gray_800	Default: #343a40. Color for dark skin.
gray_900	Default: #212529. Color for text in body.
white	Default: #ffffff.


## Example

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(fresh)
custom_colors_theme <- create_theme(
  bs4dash_color(
    lightblue = "#136377",
    olive = "#d8bc66",
    lime = "#fcec0c",
    orange = "#978d01",
    maroon = "#58482c",
    gray_x_light = "#d1c5c0"
  )
)

#author's note: complex variable names like gray-x-light become gray_x_light!
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
 OSUICode::run_example( 
  "fresh/bs4Dash-custom", 
   package = "OSUICode" 
 )
```

Super obvious tip: use Rstudio's helpful autofill/completion feature to see the full names of arguments.

## Advantages of this approach over sass approach

- We don’t have to specify the AdminLTE.scss location, as fresh hosts it here.
- We don’t have to look for all colors names as they are described along the bs4dash_color function definition. We even have a description of the default values (as well as statuses in bold), depicted in Figure 8.2 below.

## Building a bs4dash theme

General layout...:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
layout_vars <- bs4dash_layout(main_bg = "#006994")
ocean_theme <- create_theme(layout_vars)
```

Book continues like this, no value in copy/pasting all.

Highlighting the colour contrast section:

bs4dash_yiq() fine-tunes the contrast between a given color and its background. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
 bs4dash_yiq(
    contrasted_threshold = 10, 
    text_dark = "#FFF", 
    text_light = "#272c30"
  )

?bs4dash_yiq
```

Ran out of time, let's discuss - next section is v similar and short! Sadly could not get to the thematic section :(
